# SquareConnect
Java Square Connect API Implementation

Under development: This code is still under development.  Expect changes.

This code should work as a drop-in package for a Project Wonder application.

This code implements, in part, the Square Connect API found at https://docs.connect.squareup.com/api/connect/v2/.

If you find this useful dop me a note: kiberkli (at) gmail.com.

If there is sufficient interest in this code I'll add more documentation. If you're really interested me I'm available for full-time or part-time work.
